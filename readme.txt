== Description ==
Comments can be the best part of a post. So why are they always buried?

Elevated comments uses language analysis and machine learning to identify the most relevant and thoughtful comment on each of your posts. The comment is then automatically inserted near the top of the post as a simple sidebar pull quote.

Elevated comments is quite simple. Once activated, it will run automatically. It does not affect your old posts, you will only notice it our new posts and comments moving forward.

If you would like to disable comment elevation on a post you can do so using a checkbox on the Discussion Setttings metabox.

Yes. There are a number of classes in place for modifying the styling. You can also override the default template by copying it to your theme directory.
